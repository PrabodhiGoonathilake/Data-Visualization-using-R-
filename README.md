Objective
Main objective of doing this presentation is to decide the best visualisation and summary technique with application to the data set provided “credit66” related to deciding good risk and bad risk of people obtaining loans.
In order to achieve this objective three methods of visualization and summary techniques are used as follows;
Decision Tree
Logistic Binary Regression
Discriminate methods analysis

Data Transforming

In order to see the creditability of the loans the chosen continuous variables from the data set is duration of credit months, credit amount and age in years.

Then in order to see if the variables are normal or not histograms are plotted for each. It was identified that only credit amount is not normal, and therefore it is logged, in order to create a normal distributed histogram as shown in the right side:

Other two continuous variables in which the duration of the month and age in years shows a normal distribution histogram, therefore it is not logged as shown in the right side.
